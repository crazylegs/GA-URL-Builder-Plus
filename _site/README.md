# GA-URL-Builder-Plus
Google Analytics URL tracked campaign link builder. Simplified URL parameter builder for use in orgs with multiple staff posting links,u create rules to link source and medium, ensure consistant spellings for campaign names and built in URL shortening with Bit.ly

##Why does this exist?

We built this to ensure all staff who are posting links in social media and emails can add Google Analytics campaign tracking without it being confusing and without having to ask whoever understands GA. Since we started using it almost every link that goes out is tracked and tracked in a consistant way, nice clean crisp data mmmmmm. As a bonus it's got built in Bit.ly shortening

### You might want to use it of you've ever had one of these come up

- Getting asked if 'email' is the utm_source or utm_medium
- Having 4 different ways of spelling a campaign E.G. LondonEvent2014, LE2014, London2014 and LondonEvent-2014
- Staff turnover means that the person in the press team who knew how to track links has moved on
- People not wanting to add GA tracking as it makes the URL to long & ugly to post on Twitter or Facebook
- Difficulty in getting non GA uses to add GA tracking
- Mangled tracking becuase a ? was replaced with a &

###But doesn't this exist already?

Kinda, Google made this which is a good start https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en-GB however it doesn't falls down in a couple of ways

- If you don't know whether email is meant to be utm_source or utm_medium this isn't going to help you
- One person's "email-newsletter" is another person's "enews"
- Free text fields means anyone can spell campaigns differently

##Instructions

###Before use

Log in to your bit.ly account. Open index.html and find 

```
test
```

###Adding your campaigns

Edit the html

###Tweaking the source and medium

Edit the html

## Can I contribute to this?

Yes please do, fork away. It could do with a couple of things tweaking

- Move from the depreciated bit.ly api we're currently using.
- Suss out a more elegant way to add campaigns rather than editting the HTML. Google Sheets? Separate text file?
